        <h2> Past Experiences </h2>
        <p>
            I started at Liberty Mutual in June 2005 in the group disability claims organization as a claims manager. I joined a long term project as a business SME which is where I discovered I really enjoyed project work and more technical tasks. I was hired in the CI IT organization in 2014 as a systems analyst and during this role chose to apply for and was accepted to the GoForCode program to move into a developer role.         </p>
        <h2> Hobbies </h2>

            Running, Skiing, Softball, Gardening, and spending time outdoors.
